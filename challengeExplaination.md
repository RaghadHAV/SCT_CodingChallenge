Coding Challenge Explanation: 

In the `passengerInfo.js` file, you have two functions `checkPassengersCount` and `checkPassangersOfSameAge` which use an array of passenger information `passengerInfo`. Your mission is as follow: 

1. Use the function `checkPassangersCount` to return how many passengers are travelling.
