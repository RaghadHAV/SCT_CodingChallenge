Coding Challenge Explanation:

In the `passengerInfo.js` file, you have two functions `checkPassengersCount` and `checkPassangersOfSameAge` which use an array of passenger information `passengerInfo`. Your mission is as follow:

1. Add image to html `passengerDisplay.html`. The image is SCT logo `shecodestoologo.png` and it is included with the files.

2. Display the image `shecodestoologo.png` in 200px for both width and height.

3. Use the function `checkPassangersCount` to return how many passengers are travelling.

4. Use the function `checkPassangersOfSameAge` to write a code that check how many passengers has the same age, return the number of these passengers.

5. Display the return of each function in the `passengerDisplay.html`
